        "#  Lab 1, Exercise 2\n## Introduction to Julia & Floating Point Arithmetic\n\n## Using Packages\nThe Julia language includes many powerful features.  While many of the most commonly used functions and macros are available by default, other functions are only avaliable if you \"import\" a module.  For this exercise, we'll be using the Random and Statistics modules.  (Both Random and Statistics are part of Julia's \"Base\" set of modules that are distributed with Julia.  Later we'll learn how to add packages that are not included in Base)\n\nTo be able to access functions in a  module, execute `import MyModule` and then execute `MyModule.fn(x)` to call a function named `fn` with parameter `x`.\nAlternatively, `using MyModule` will import all the functions that the Module module has specified for being \"exported\" into the current namespace.  Basically, this means you don't have to write `MyModule.` before every call to a function provided by `MyModule.`  Sometimes that is very convenient.  Other times that risks creating confusion about which module is being reference."

        "The first time you execute any command, it will take a little longer for the Julia kernel to start.  The first time you import a module, Julia will parse the code in the module and compile (many of) its functions.  The next time you import the same module it will be faster, as it won't need to parse and compile the module (as long as the module hasn't changed).\n\n## Writing Functions\nIt will be very useful to write your code as functions.  I strongly recommend you develop a habit of writing code in the form of functions.  A good rule of thumb is to try to keep each function to no more than one page of paper.  Julia provides multiple syntaxes for writing functions, as described [here in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/index.html). (I suggest stopping before the subsection on \"Operators Are Functions\" for now.)\n\n## Example Function\nConsider an astronomer analyzing data from a large survey or simulation.  A common task is to compute the mean value ($m$) and sampler variance ($s^2$) of a data set ($y_i$) with $i=1...N$.  The data might be of observations of some quantity or the results of performing a Monte Carlo integration.  In principle, this seems very simple.  In practice, there can be some suprising behavior.  In this example, you will investigate some of the potential complications of performing even basic mathematical calculations.\n\na. Generate an array of simulated data using:"

That will only happen once the function is called.  Since the last line of the cell is the end of the function, the output of the cell is the function.  For clarity, Jupyter prints just the function name.  Now let's try out using this function."

Are the output consistent with your expectations?\n\nINSERT RESPONSE\n\n## Broadcasting\nLook more closely at the function `generate_sample` above.\nNote the syntax `.+` that tells julia the programmer wants to \"broadcast\" the scalar `true_mean` to have the same dimensions as the result of `randn(...)`.  What do you think would happen if you replaced this with `true_mean+randn(N)`?  Try it. How does the behavior compare to what you expected?\n\nRestore the code in `generate_sample` and execute the cell again, so the\nrest of the lab works as intended.\n\na. What is the advantage of julia having different syntax for arithmetic on variables with compatible dimensions from arithmetic on variables with different dimensions?\n\nINSERT RESPONSE\n\n## Calculating basic summary statistics\nNow, we're going to generate a much larger sample of numbers and compute their\nmean and standard deviations using multiple different methods.  You will compare the results.  The goal is to help you to understand when floating point arithmetic is likely to be problematic, so you can anticipate potential pitfalls that might affect your own research."
