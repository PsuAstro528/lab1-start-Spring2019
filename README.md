# Astro 528 Lab 1

## Exercise 1
#### Goal:  Learn the basics of core development tools
For this first exercise, there will be very little coding, because we'll focus on getting used to using git, GitHub, the ICS-ACI Jupyter notebook server (or JuliaBox if you prefer), Jupyter notebooks, Julia, a Julia module (Test) and Travis-CI.com.

Start at the course website where it offers [help getting setup to complete this lab using ICS-ACI](https://psuastro528.github.io/lessons/how-to-use-aci/).
Once you get a Jupyter notebook server running, start reading through and editting ex1.ipynb.
Once you're reading to commit and push your responce, look at the [help on the course website](https://psuastro528.github.io/lessons/how-to-use-aci/) for instructions on commiting, pushing and submiting your work

## Exercise 2
#### Goal:  Experience the perils of floating point arithmetic
From your Jupyter notebook server, work through ex2.ipynb
